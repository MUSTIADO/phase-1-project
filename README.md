# JavaScript Project Mode: Single Page Application

Welcome to my JavaScript Single Page Application project! This project consolidates everything I've learned so far, integrating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a dynamic single-page web application that interacts with a public API.

## Project Overview

In this project, I've built a Single Page Application (SPA) that accesses data from a public API. The frontend is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with all interactions between the client and the API handled asynchronously using JSON as the communication format. The project fulfills the following requirements:

- Accesses data from a public API using JSON Server.
- Displays a collection of at least 5 objects(one object at a time), each with at least 3 attributes.
- Runs entirely on a single HTML page without redirects or reloads.
- Implements at least 3 distinct event listeners with unique callback functions.
- Utilizes array iteration methods such as `map`, `forEach`, or `filter` for manipulating API data.
- Follows good coding practices, keeping the code DRY (Do not repeat yourself) and organized.

## Features

- **Data Display**: The application fetches data from the API and dynamically displays it on the page.
- **Interactivity**: Various interactive features such as search, filter, or sorting functionalities are implemented using event listeners.
- **Array Iteration**: The application utilizes array iteration method to manipulate and present the data in a meaningful way.
- **Responsive Design**: The user interface is designed to be responsive and optimized for different screen sizes.
